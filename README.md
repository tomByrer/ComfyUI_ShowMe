# ShowMe

ShowMe is a ComfyUI extension that adds an annotation layer to the canvas.\
Exported workflows can carry ShowMe annotations with them, readable by anyone with ShowMe installed.

## Uses:

- Ask what a graph does, follow data flow, and inspect important nodes.
- Mark up the graph and save notes for later review.

## Features

- Manual notes with brush, arrows, shapes, highlights, and text labels.
- Ask AI can read the current workflow and place explanations near the relevant nodes.
- Separate manual and AI annotation layers, so AI explanations can be replaced without deleting manual notes.
- Annotations are saved in the workflow JSON under `extra.showme_annotations`.
